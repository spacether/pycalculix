## Sample Program
```
# this is from examples/hole-in-plate-full.py
import pycalculix as pyc

# Vertical hole in plate model, make model
proj_name = 'hole-in-plate-full'
model = pyc.FeaModel(proj_name)
model.set_units('m') # this sets dist units to meters

# Define variables we'll use to draw part geometry
diam = 2.0 # hole diam
ratio = 0.45
width = diam/ratio   #plate width
print('D=%f, H=%f, D/H=%f' % (diam, width, diam/width))
length = 2*width  #plate length

# Draw part geometry, you must draw the part CLOCKWISE, x, y = radial, axial
part = pyc.Part(model)
part.goto(length*0.5, -width*0.5)
part.draw_line_ax(width)
part.draw_line_rad(-length)
part.draw_line_ax(-width)
part.draw_line_rad(length)
hole_lines = part.draw_hole(0, 0, diam*0.5, filled=False)
model.set_ediv(hole_lines, 10)
part.chunk()
model.plot_geometry(proj_name+'_geom') # view the geometry

# set loads and constraints
pressure = -1000
model.set_load('press', part.top, pressure)
model.set_load('press', part.bottom, pressure)
model.set_constr('fix', ['P6', 'P8'], 'y')
model.set_constr('fix', ['P4', 'P7'], 'x')

# set part material
mat = pyc.Material('steel')
mat.set_mech_props(7800, 210*(10**9), 0.3)
model.set_matl(mat, part)

# set the element type and mesh database
model.set_eshape('quad', 2)
model.set_etype('plstress', part, 0.1)
model.mesh(1.0, 'gmsh') # mesh 1.0 fineness, smaller is finer
model.plot_elements(proj_name+'_elem')   # plot part elements
model.plot_pressures(proj_name+'_press')
model.plot_constraints(proj_name+'_constr')

# make and solve the model
prob = pyc.Problem(model, 'struct')
prob.solve()

# view and query results
sx = prob.rfile.get_nmax('Sx')
print('Sx_max: %f' % sx)

# Plot results
fields = 'Sx,Sy,S1,S2,S3,Seqv,ux,uy,utot,ex'    # store the fields to plot
fields = fields.split(',')
for field in fields:
    fname = proj_name+'_'+field
    prob.rfile.nplot(field, fname, display=False)
```

## Usage
1. To run a pycalcuix file you have to have pycalulix installed,
see 'Installation' above
2. The you can then write your own pycalculix programs or run one of the example files here:
https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix/tree/master/examples
3. To run a file:  

#### Windows
- Graphical user interface:
  - Double click the file  
  If the .py extension is associated correctly you can double click it to run the .py program
- Console:
  - cd into the directory with your .py file in it, then in the terminal enter
  ```
  python the_program.py
  ```  
  where the_program.py is the name of the file that you are running
  This assumes that python3 is your active python installation

#### Mac/Linux
- Console:
  - cd into the directory with your .py file in it, then in the terminal enter
  ```
  python3 the_program.py
  ```  
  where the_program.py is the name of the file that you are running


## Elements Supported:
Axisymmetric, plane stress, and plane strain elements are supported.

- First and second order triangles and quadrilaterals are supported.
  - First order elements only have corner nodes
  - Second order elements have corner and midside nodes

Second order elements produce more accurate results
Setting element divisions on lines is supported


## Geometry Building
- One can build separate parts made of points, lines, arcs, and areas.
- Straight lines and arcs are currently supported.
- One can draw a part made of straight lines, then smooth out corners by adding arcs with the part method: part.fillet_lines(L1, L2, arc_radius)
- The new arc will be tangent to both adjacent lines.


## Loading
- Force loading
- Constant pressure
- Linearly varying pressure (water pressure)
- Gravity
- Rotational speed forces
- Displacement constraints
- Loads are stored on geometry primitives (points lines, areas) and
can be applied before or after meshing.


## Files Produced
Meshing and solving are done in the background using cgx or gmsh for
meshing, and Calculix ccx for solving.

Files Used:
- .fbd (Calculix cgx geometry file)
- .inp (Calculix solver input file, or mesh definition)
- .geo (Gmsh geometry file)
- .msh (Gmsh native mesh file)
- .frd (Calculix ccx nodal results file, values are at nodes and were
  created by interpolating element integration point results back to
  the nodes)
- .dat (Calculix ccx element results file, includes integration point
  results)


## Uninstall

## Development
- Download this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:spacether/pycalculix.git
```
- Make python3 virtual env
```
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate it
  - Windows `venv\scripts\activate`
  - Mac/linux `source venv/bin/activate`
- Locally install pycalculix
```
pip install -e .
pycalculix-add-feaprograms
```
- Now any changes that you make to your local version of pycalculix
  will be live in your virtual environment
